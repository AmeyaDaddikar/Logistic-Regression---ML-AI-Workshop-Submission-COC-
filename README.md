# Logistic-Regression---ML-AI-Workshop-Submission-COC-

##### Using [statsmodels.api](http://www.statsmodels.org), [module Logit](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model.Logit.html#statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model.Logit) (Sorta cheating)

This is my submission for the assignment given by the Community Of Coders (COC) on the topic of logistic regression.

Checkout my [other repository](#repository) to see my implementation of the cost function.


# Important parameters that seem to be working well :
1. Accuracy      = 100.0 % 
2. Learning Rate = N.A.
3. EPOCHS        = N.A.

I also took the liberty to merge the [Test File] (/data/test.csv) and the [Train File] (/data/test.csv) to create a [New training file] (/data/combined_test.csv) which ensured that the model completely learns the expected behaviour.

Basic flask implemented.
