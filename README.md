# Logistic-Regression---ML-AI-Workshop-Submission-COC-
This is my submission for the assignment given by the Community Of Coders (COC) on the topic of logistic regression.


# Important parameters that seem to be working well :
1. Accuracy      = 88.0 %
2. Learning Rate = 3e-3
3. EPOCHS        = 10000

As of now, Flask is not being implemented and the progra only works on console.
Don't worry, still got 3 days !!!!
