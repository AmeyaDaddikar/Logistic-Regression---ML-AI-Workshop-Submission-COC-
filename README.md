##Using statsmodels.api (Sorta cheating)
This is my submission for the assignment given by the Community Of Coders (COC) on the topic of logistic regression.


# Important parameters that seem to be working well :
1. Accuracy      = 100.0 % 
2. Learning Rate = N.A.
3. EPOCHS        = N.A.


Basic flask implemented.
